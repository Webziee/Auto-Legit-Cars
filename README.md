## 5. REPORT ON 'LEGIT AUTO CARS' 
The development team has started to develop and build the "Legit Auto Cars" appplication, which is designed for a sole automobile
company to connect with their clientel. This idea came about after extensive research on other apps like Auto-Trader, Cars.co.za, and 
WeBuyCars, but is leaning more towards the WeBuyCars idea in which an app is created for a sole company to interact with their clients
(potential clients) whereas the other 2 apps allow for multiple companies, and potential clinets to interact. With the use of 'Legit Auto Cars', 
users will be able to upload automobiles they want to sell to a company and view the different vehicles that that company has available
for sale online. This Android app's goal is to provide a smooth and effective user experience by incorporating new and creative features into the 
fundamental functionality of three popular car apps. These features are intended to improve user engagement and the user's overall 
experience while purchasing and selling vehicles.

### Purpose of the 'Legit Auto Cars' Application
The 'Legit Auto Cars' application's main goal is to ease the processes of: viewing cars for sale, uploading cars to sell, making bookings, 
and communication between and amoung the company and its clients as this will all be done online and from the app. The application does 
not allow clients or the company to purchase or sell cars directly (No Money Involved), but rather provides a medium for the 2 primary users
to engage, interact and communicate with eachother. The app includes features that makes the clients and the companys lives much easier such 
as viewing, uploading, whatsapp messaging integration, booking a test drive, advanced searching, and to be implemented: a favourites feature
and a price comparison tool. The app helps connect buyers and sellers by providing a platform where users can quickly view cars for sale and 
submit their own cars for review. It ensures a seamless digital experience for users by doing away with the necessity for physical paperwork 
and in-person dealership visits.
